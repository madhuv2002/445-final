# cs445Final: Face Swap (mv16 and tinajb2)


To run this code, first download this [https://github.com/JeffTrain/selfie/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat ] dat file in order to use the dlib landmarks library. Next, open this folder in a jupyter notebook or google colab with the face image, video, and utils.py files also saved in the same directory. Run the notebook to see the swapped video.
If you encounter errors with dlib, ensure you have installed it using ```pip install dlib``` [https://pypi.org/project/dlib/]
